Rah rah pom pom play girl
Pom pom play girl
(Oooooo)
You see her in a short skirt down on the grass
Sheõs wonderinõ if the teamõs gonna run kick or pass
(Chi chi bah oooooo)
Since she doesnõt really know why sheõs wavinõ her hands
Sheõs a-thinking ôbout the boy sittinõ up in the stands
Rah rah pom pom play girl
Pom pom play girl
(Chi chi bah)
Just a little social clique with the other song queens
With a freshman or a sophomore she wouldnõt be seen
(Chi chi bah oooooo)
Sheõs a doll and she knows it and she thinks that her face
Will get her any body any thing and any place
Rah rah pom pom play girl
Pom pom play girl
Oooooo
Chi chi bah
(Oooooo)
Since sheõs the head cheerleader she dates the quarterback
And her best friendõs going out with the full back
(Chi chi bah oooooo)
She might even run for an office this spring
And that ought to really make her telephone ring
Rah rah pom pom play girl
Pom pom play girl
(Chi chi bah pom pom play girl)
Wooooo
(Chi chi bah pom pom play girl)
Wooo
(Chi chi bah pom pom play girl)
Shake it
(Chi chi bah pom pom play girl)
Wave those pom poms all around
(Chi chi bah pom pom play girl)
(Chi chi bah pom pom play girl)
(Chi chi bah pom pom play girl)
Wow
(Chi chi bah pom pom play girl)
Wow
(Chi chi bah pom pom play girl)
